### Blinky

Blinky extends the basic introduction of johhny-five with client input support. User input is collected on the client, then sent via websocket to the server, which uses johnny-five to control the arduino.

## Installation

This server is based on the circuit schematic as diagramed [here][http://node-ardx.org/exercises/1].

Once you have built your ciruit clone the repo. 

To start the server just use:

```
npm start
```
